# Software Project Management

- Main techniques and approaches for software project management.
- Agile and Extreme Programming is flexible and under-documented.

## Project Resources
- Human
- Software
- Hardware

## Process Maturity

CMMI Capability Maturity model has 5 maturity levels.

- Initial
- Repeatable
- Defined
- Managed
- Optimizing

## Estimation and Metrics

We need metrics and estimation for when and how much resource the software project needs.

- Base for metrics:
: Size Oriented: KLOC: Kilo line of codes
: Function oriented: FP: Function points

## Staffing

- An organization that optimizes between flexibility and process compliance is what is needed.
- 2 to 7 people of groups for programmers.
- Since technical personnel in the software field change jobs very frequently, keeping the rest of the group informed about everybody’s accomplishment helps preparing personnel “backup.”


## Risk Management

- MAnaging the difficulty in software development.
- A risk could affect a project in two ways: delaying the completion time, and increasing the cost.

## Outsourcing

- It is best to develop only what an organization defines as its “core competency” and outsource others.

## Maintainance

- If a system in operation reports frequent errors (defects) and maintenance is difficult and expensive, it is time to consider a re-engineering process also.
