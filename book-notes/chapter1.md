# Software Engineering Concepts

- Software depand is increasingly increasing, the offer is unable to keep up with it, this results in a growing gap between demand and supply for the software.
- Additionally, high supply failure rates in supply is also adding to this gap.

*This is why software engineering field is established**

## Software

Software definition includes;
- Documentation
- Training packages
- Maintainance options
- personnel dedicated to help the operation

Small projects that can be created by one person in few weeks is not in the scope of software engineering, it deals with big and complex softwares.

- Engineering efforts that define the success of the project mostly takes place *before the implementation*.
- Hardware products wear out, software does not.
- Abstraction to modeliing takes seconds in software engineering. (Compared to other diciplines.)

### Types of Software

- Business
- System
- Real-time
- Embedded
- Scientific/Engineering

A big share of the softwares belong in the business softtware.

## Software Engineering

- Foundation can be accepted as 1970.
- The field is involved with the approaches ad techniques used in the development of complex software projects.
- Software problems can't be completely specified until they are completely solved.
- It is known that locating and integrating a previously written piece of code is more advantageous than to do it all over again. (reuse of a component)

**Post coding takes more effort than precoding and coding combined.**

## The Process

- A process is an ordered set of tasks to accomplish a goal!
- Waterfall process model (lifecycle): One activity (requirements, design, implmenetation, maintainance) needs to be completely studied and finished before the next could start. This is a "phased" approach with the linear flow of information.
- New projects follow evolutionary approaches rather than phased ones.
- evolutionary process models;
  * Spiral
  * Rapid prototyping

*Spiral vs Rapid Protoyping*

Spiral has no costumer input during dev, in the other hand rapid prototyping has costumer input during dev and till the prototype is approved.

- Abstraction is a fundamental concept and its levels are instrumental in explaining the real meaning of the terminology.

*Abstraction level Highest to lowest*
- Paradigm
- Process Model (Lifecycle)
- Methodology
