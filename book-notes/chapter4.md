# Object Oriented Programming

- Today, any new project is developed using OO
- should not be expected to be the silver bullet for wicked software problems.

*Encapsulation* concept is closely related with the “controlled access” principle.
- An object provides access functions for external entities if its data
needs manipulation by them.

**Encapsulation**: suggests that an object represents its data primitives along
with its functional primitives. ( information hiding )

*Object Based Enviroments*
- Some early tools were presented as object oriented but they were just object based
- Object based tools had encapsulation but not polymorphism or inheritance.


**Inheritance**: When a class is defined in terms of specialization of a base class, the derived
class automatically owns any properties and methods of the base class.

**Interfaces**: the publicly visible specification of the services and accessible parts of a module.
- Their structures are strictly defined in the component protocols.  

**Polymophism**: automatic selection of the correct method at run time.
- If the same name is used for methods defined in different classes, without
checking the type of an object its method can be activated.

**Composition**: mechanism to build more detailed modules out of existing ones is composition.
- This is physically including classes inside a class.

### Composition versus inheritance

Inheritance derives one class from another, composition defines a class as the sum of its parts.

## Object Oriented Methodologies

There have been two successful attempts to unite different
approaches into a standard methodology. *Fusion Method, Unified Modeling Language (UML)*

*Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC)* modes or *use-case diagrams*
are used to support requirements analysis for the majority of the approaches.


- Use cases: Subsystem design
- E-R Model: Message Design
- CRC: Responsibilities Design, Class and object Design
