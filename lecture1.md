# Software and Its Engineering

- Software engineering is the practical engineering of Computer Science.
- Software demand has been grown exponentially since 1950.
- So we made it into a systematic method to satisfy this need.
- Software needs to be evolving, and its easy to change it. (Maintainability)
- Currently its not humanly possible to write code to supply this demand.
- Software crisis (1980) 'we can't do it'.
- There is a strong connection with Software and other engineering disciplines.
  * We mostly solve our problems with software.
- Programming is not the problem, engineering the system is.
  * All the algorithmic level programs are already written and exists.

*Software Engineering:* Trying to find methods and tools to solve big software problems during the lifecycle of a software project.

- Don't apply the methods you will learn in this course in small projects, its useless.
