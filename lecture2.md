## Software Types
- System Software
- Real-time Software
  * Any function needs to be respond in a defined time interval.
  * EG: Every query needs to be finished in 2 seconds!
- Business Software
- Engineering and scientific Software
- Embeded Software
  * You don't really know the software in the device, but its there.
- Fault tolerant software
- Safety critical software
  * Fly control systems (life critical)
  * Test coverage, unit testing important
  * Even flight Entertainment systems are considered critical and needs to be extently tested.

## Software Myths
- Getting more people on a project won't make the production fast, makes it slow.
- Customer usually gives a broad project outline, this causes "Creeping Requirements"
  * Customer asks for additional requirements, or changes to already implemented parts of the project.
  * More incorrect and incomplete requirements means more development time, and increased complexity.
- Working program doesn't mean your job is done!

## Software Crisis
- Demand for software increases.
- Offer stays almost the same, this means the price increases in an open market.
- Additionally software success is about 50%, (light-blue)

## System Engineering
- System Flow Diagram
- UML Diagrams, SysML, UMI

## Software Project Management
- Other engineering products are Tangible, you can hold it in your hand.
- But in software engineering, we produce abstractions.
- Impact of change:
  * During definition: 1 X
  * During development: 1.5-6 X
  * During operations: 60-100 X, (It becomes too complex to change things)
- Put as much time as you can during definition time.
- Make the software as changeable as possible, clean code.

## Process
**Process:** A word we took from the old programming languages, a function that doesn't return anything, but it would execute some actions.

Process approaches:
- Rational Unified Process, heavy process based
- Agile Methodology, light process based

*Note:* Quality standard certs like iso-1000, certifies processes, not the product.

### Process Maturity Levels
CMM, USA gov wants level 3 quality, there is aerospace companies who are 5th level
- Initial
- Repeatable
- Defined
- Managed
- Optimizing
  * Changing the process when we think it needs changes during a project.

### Team Structure
- Democratic Decentralized, DD: Horizontal communication
- Controlled Decentralized, CD: a defined leader partitions problems among sub groups.
- Controlled Centralized, CC: vertical communication, team coordination by leader.
