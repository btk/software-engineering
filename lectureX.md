## Metrics for Quality

- Correctness: Defects per KLOC
- Maintainability: Mean time to change the software
- Reliability: Mean time between failures
- Integrity: ability to withstand attacks.

*About midterm:* open book multiple choice (most probably). If multiple choice, answer one choice but the MOST CORRECT choice. Other choices may look partially correct.

Probably 2 or three small exams one after the other, like 15-20 minutes each, one or two minutes in between.

# Software Development Process

Process: Ordered set of steps.

- Things before coding
- After coding (Maintainance)

* More things you do before coding, you will need less time after coding.

##Â Process
- Requirements
- Specification
- Design
- Coding
- Testing & Debugging
- Intergration
- Maintainance

> This is like a waterfall, so you don't climb back up. But you should be able to (!)

* Software engineering problems are wicked problems. You don't know the problem fully till you finish it.
> So we have iterations.

**- waterfall = phase -**

*Debugging* Why do we call errors in the code bugs? and what is debugging?
