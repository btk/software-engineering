## Metrics for Quality

- Correctness: Defects per KLOC
- Maintainability: Mean time to change the software
- Reliability: Mean time between failures
- Integrity: ability to withstand attacks.

*About midterm:* open book multiple choice (most probably). If multiple choice, answer one choice but the MOST CORRECT choice. Other choices may look partially correct.

Probably 2 or three small exams one after the other, like 15-20 minutes each, one or two minutes in between.

# Software Development Process

Process: Ordered set of steps.

- Things before coding
- After coding (Maintainance)

* More things you do before coding, you will need less time after coding.
